# Fireworks

Fireworks uses JavaScript and HTML Canvas to allow for users to interactively create their own firework display.  

## Gameplay

Click or click and drag on the screen to shoot fireworks.  This is achieved by using event listeners checking for `mousedown`, `mousemove`, and `mouseup`.

```js
shoot() {
  let that = this;
  that.canvas.addEventListener('mousedown', (e) => {
    e.preventDefault();
    let x = e.clientX;
    let y = e.clientY;
    this.dragStart = [x, y];
    this.drag = true;
    that.shootFirework(this.dragStart, that.game, that.single);
  })

  that.canvas.addEventListener('mousemove', e => {
    if (this.drag) {
      let x = e.clientX;
      let y = e.clientY;
      this.dragEnd = [x, y];
      this.single = false;
      that.shootFirework(this.dragEnd, that.game, this.single);
    }
  })

  that.canvas.addEventListener('mouseup', e => {
    this.drag = false;
    this.single = true;
  })
}
```

## Features

This project required a good amount of trigonometry in order to calculate the correct coordinates for the firework.  The color of the firework is determined by its target location, while a particle's color just by its position.


When a firework reaches its target location, an explosion is generated by releasing a number of particles from that location.  Those particles may explode again, depending on their `particle.gunPowder`.

```js
explode(firework) {
  if (firework.gunPowder > 0){
    for (let i = 0; i < this.setN(firework); i++) {
      let rad = Util.makeCircle(Util.getRandomInteger(-50, 50));
      let newPos = [firework.pos[0] + rad[0], firework.pos[1] + rad[1]];
      let particle = new Particle({pos: newPos, game: this, startPos: firework.pos, gunPowder: firework.gunPowder - 1});
      this.addParticle(particle);
    }
    firework.gunPowder -= 1;
  }
}
```

## Future Features

* Include computer player so that users can play a memory game, similar to 'Simon'.

* Game mode and play mode.

* Improve styling.
